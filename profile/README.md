# Splunk> SOAR

Welcome to the Splunk> SOAR Community! SOAR is Splunk's premier Security Automation, Orchestration, and Response ("SOAR") platform. With it, our customers can automate entire or partial workflows for their employees across an infinite number of use-cases.

This [GitHub organization](https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/collaborating-with-groups-in-organizations/about-organizations) represents our efforts to open-source our SOAR Apps so our customers can look at how our code works, make improvements, and generally build a stronger community through the free exchange of ideas.

## SOAR

## Reporting Issues
If you've found a problem with an app but don't want to contribute a fix, that's ok! All you need to do is go to the [Issues](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/creating-an-issue) section of the app repo and click 'New Issue'. The page that appears will show our convenient issue templates. However, if the app *doesn't* have an Issues page, that means you need to submit a bug report via [Splunk Support](https://splunkcommunities.force.com/customers/apex/SubmitCase).

![Issues Templates](https://github.com/splunk-soar-connectors/.github/blob/main/.github/Images/Github-Issue-Templates.png)

All you have to do is fill out the form...

![Bug Report](https://github.com/splunk-soar-connectors/.github/blob/main/.github/Images/Github-Bug-Template.png) 

...and our community will be able to help review and propose fixes.

Of course, you should definitely check if there is already an open issue and if so, add a thumbs-up reaction to it for visiblity.
